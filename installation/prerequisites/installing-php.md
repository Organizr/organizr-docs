## Windows

### Download and Install

1. Download PHP for Windows from here: [http://windows.php.net/download](https://windows.php.net/download) (Non Thread Safe version used in this guide)
2. Create a folder called PHP under your Nginx directory e.g. `C:\nginx\php` and copy the downloaded files to this folder

### Running PHP as a service

1. Install NSSM - Skip to Step 2 if already installed
   1. Download NSSM from: [https://nssm.cc/download](https://nssm.cc/download)
   2. Copy the nssm.exe from the win32 or win64 folder depending on your system to `C:\Windows\System32`
2. If you’ve got `nssm` already setup, open command prompt as admin.
3. Type in the following `cmd nssm install php`
   1. Path = `C:\nginx\php\php-cgi.exe`
   2. Startup directory = `C:\nginx\php`
   3. Arguments = `-b 127.0.0.1:9000`
   4. See image below for Example
4. Install Service
5. On the opened cmd prompt type in `nssm start php` to start the PHP service.
6. If the installed PHP service doesn’t start, then try manually running the `php-cgi.exe` file in `C:\nginx\php\`&#x20;
   1. &#x20;If you get a missing ‘VCRUNTIME’ related error then follow the solution on this link: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30811668/php-7-missing-vcruntime140-dll](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30811668/php-7-missing-vcruntime140-dll)
7. Make a copy of one of the `php.ini-development` or `php.ini-production` files and rename it to `php.ini`
8. Open the php.ini file and search for the following and uncomment each:
   1. extension\_dir = "ext"
   2. extension=php\_openssl.dll
   3. extension=php\_pdo\_sqlite.dll
   4. extension=php\_curl.dll
   5. extension=php\_sqlite3.dll
9. Please note that if you are running PHP 7.2 or higher, look for the below lines and uncomment them instead:
   1. extension\_dir = "ext"
   2. extension=openssl
   3. extension=pdo\_sqlite
   4. extension=curl
   5. extension=sqlite3
10. Also, uncomment the following line and add `ext` to the end of it:
    1. sqlite3.extension\_dir =
       1. So that is becomes: `sqlite3.extension_dir = ext`
11. On the opened `cmd`prompt type in `nssm restart php` to restart the PHP service to apply the changes in `php.ini`.
