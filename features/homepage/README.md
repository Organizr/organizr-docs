# Homepage

## Summary

The homepage houses all of your media items formatted in a very nice UI for you and your users.

### Homepage Output

### Setting up the Homepage Tab

{% hint style="info" %}
Settings / Tab Editor / Tabs
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

By default, Organizr automatically sets up the Tab for the homepage but it will not be active.  To activate it just toggle the `Active` switch.  Once it is active, you can now configure `Category` and `Group` which you can get to by clicking the:pencil: button.

The URL will never change as that points to the Organizr API.  You may change the `Tab Name` and `Tab Image` to anything you like.  As for the other options, those are covered in `Adding a New Tab`

### Editing Homepage Items

{% hint style="info" %}
Settings / Tab Editor / Homepage Items
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

To setup a Homepage item, all you need to do is click on any of the homepage items to edit those settings.  You may head to each Homepage item information page next.
