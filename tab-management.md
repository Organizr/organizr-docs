## Summary

Organizr Tabs is the main focus of Organizr.  You can have as many tabs as you like and even put them into Categories.  Each tab can be configured to be opened in an iframe or in a new window.  In your Settings in Tab Editor, it will list all your current tabs. From this screen you can add, delete, disable, etc

{% hint style="warning" %}
Organizr **does not** do any type of proxying. The URL you are putting in the Tab URL **must** be accessible from your browser. This means if you want external access to the items you are putting in Organizr, they too must be externally accessible via a reverse proxy (recommended) or opened port.
{% endhint %}

## Tab Editor Settings

**Rearranging Tabs:** Hover over the three dots on the left side of the tabs, click and drag to where you want it.&#x20;

**Home Symbol (See image below):** This will take you to the Homepage setting based on a best guess of your tab name.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

**Category:** Group tabs together so you can collapse them (set up your categories in the Categories tab below Tab Editor)&#x20;

**Group:** Minimum Group that the tab should be shown to. Usually should match ServerAuth if you are using it.

[server-authentication](features/server-authentication/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Type:**

*
  * Internal - only for Organizr things (Homepage and Settings)
  * iFrame - your standard tab
  * New Window - Opens a new window/tab

**Default:** Choose which tab loads when you first login.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you set the default tab to something that a user doesn't have access to, it will load the first in the list that they do.
