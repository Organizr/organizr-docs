## Summary

To display text only for specific user groups.

In this example, we are using groupID `999` which is the Guest Group.

    if(activeInfo.user.groupID !== 999){
        var cssSettings = `
            .hidden-for-non-guest {
                display: none;
            }
        `;
        $('#guest-css').html(cssSettings);
    }
</script>
<style id="guest-css"></style>
<div class="hidden-for-non-guest">
    <h1>You're a guest.  Please log in!</h1>
